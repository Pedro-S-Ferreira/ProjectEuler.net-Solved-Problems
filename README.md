# ProjectEuler.net-Solved-Problems
ProjectEuler.net is a website which offers challenging problems which put the user mathematical and coding skills to the test. The problems it offers revolve around obtaining a number, which, due to the nature of the problems, can only be obtained by coding for the solution. The website has a rule that although any language can be used, the code must finish running in under a minute. This is to prevent brute-forcing by simply trying every possibility and to cultivate efficiently written code. In this project is the source of the problems I have solved so far along side a README file which highlights all the relevant skills I have acquired solving each problem.
