# ProjectEuler.net-Solved-Problems
ProjectEuler.net is a website which offers challenging problems which put the user mathematical and coding skills to the test. The problems it offers revolve around obtaining a number, which, due to the nature of the problems, can only be obtained by coding for the solution. The website has a rule that although any language can be used, the code must finish running in under a minute. This is to prevent brute-forcing by simply trying every possibility and to cultivate efficiently written code. In this project is the source of the problems I have solved so far along side a README file which highlights all the relevant skills I have acquired solving each problem.

All problems: The efficient use of lists, functions, including ones that I have defined, variables, using mathematical functions to edit them.

Problems 10, 19, 22 and 24: The use of pre installed modules in Python's standard library, including math, datetime, csv, itertools.

Problem 15 and 31: The use of list as 2D plan, using each item as coordinates to solve the correspondent problem.

Problem 22: Understanding and manipulating data in the csv format and getting the correct answer from it.
